# TODO

## Server
- Create rooms for the clients
- Split out code into folders and break up the code to be neater
- Create a better framework around message handling from clients
- Some way of identifying clients?


## Client
- Create client
- Allow client to send and recieve messages from the server
- Allow client to create rooms and/or join rooms
- Some way of identifying clients

## Other
- Update the cdll library or move to a different type of structure for storing connections and clubs
- Abstract message / message header functions and reading from socket to be less fragile


# Future

- Templatify the server and client:
connections are part of the server, they are either given uuid's or we just use the fd.
user data gets assigned to the connection, this can then be used by software for storing information related to the software.
we just make the server act more like an api with calls to send messages, and handler function pointers for accepting new connections and on message handlers.
client can also be created as an api.
