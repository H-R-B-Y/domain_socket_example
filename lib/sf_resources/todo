re-implement basic message server
implement non blocking socket writes

consolidate the message struct so that it can be used for both reading and writing, 
this way we can create a single message struct and send it to multiple clients.

Also resetting partial reads (maybe partial writes) should flush the buffer
and clear the fd for up to the ammount of bytes left in the message.
